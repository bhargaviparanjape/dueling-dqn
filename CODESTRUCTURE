QNetwork: Inherits Module

LinearQNetwork: Inherits QNetwork
	__init__: inputs(gym env??)
	forward: state vector*linear weight vector => value vector

MLPQNetwork: Inherits QNetwork
	forward: MLP(s,a) => q 

ConvolutionQNetwork : Inherits QNetwork
	forward: Conv(s,a) => q

ReplayMemory
	__init__: inputs(gym env, max_memory)
	sample_batch
	append

DQN_Agent
	__init__: inputs(env) call burn_in_memory
	greedy_policy:
	epsilon_greedy_policy:
	train: q-learning implementation (SGD driver), based on flag decide where to sample from (replay memory or online sampling)
	test: function to run 20 episodes with some poilicy and return reward (also call Monitor here to plot performance curves and capture video snippet)
